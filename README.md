# EpiNet

EpiNet is being shaped as a **general node/edge network analysis toolkit**.
Epidemiology is one possible use case, but the core logic is intentionally broader:
load entities and relationships, compute graph features, optionally train a simple
outcome model, and run shortest-path analysis in parallel.

This repository is still a prototype. It should be treated as a demonstrator, not
clinical or public-health decision support.

## What Is Implemented

- CSV node and edge loading.
- Network construction with NetworkX.
- Node-level graph features:
  - degree
  - weighted degree
  - clustering
  - component size
  - isolate flag
  - optional betweenness, closeness, and PageRank
- Optional RandomForest outcome model using graph features plus numeric node attributes.
- Semi-supervised support: nodes with a blank outcome are treated as unlabeled
  scaffold — they shape the graph features but are excluded from training, so a
  graph can mix labeled and context/infrastructure nodes.
- Iterative model evaluation over repeated train/test splits, reporting the
  mean, standard deviation, and range of each metric instead of a single noisy split.
- Community-aware splitting (`--split-strategy community`): whole graph
  communities stay on one side of the split, so scores estimate generalization
  to unseen regions of the network instead of leaking structure between
  connected train/test nodes.
- Label-permutation null model (`--permutation-test N`) with empirical
  p-values, so observed scores are compared against chance instead of read in isolation.
- Shortest-path analysis from source nodes to explicit target nodes or to nodes with a target outcome.
- Feature-space clustering: k-means centroids plus per-node distance to every
  outcome-class centroid (Euclidean or Mahalanobis) — a nearest-centroid view
  that complements the topological shortest paths with attribute-space distance.
- Per-target coverage summaries — the counterpart to the per-source nearest-target
  table — showing how many sources reach each target and at what distance.
- CSV/JSON outputs for downstream inspection.
- Publication-style PNG figures (`epinet_viz.py`): network overview, degree
  distribution, feature importance, metric stability, and confusion matrix.

The older `epinet-analysis.py` and `epinet-analysis-v2.py` scripts remain as early prototypes.
The recommended entry point is now `epinet_toolkit.py`.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python epinet_toolkit.py \
  --nodes synthetic_nodes.csv \
  --edges synthetic_edges.csv \
  --outcome-column Outcome \
  --target-outcome 1 \
  --output-dir epinet_outputs
```

This runs the two main lenses side by side:

1. graph feature generation and a simple outcome model
2. shortest-path summaries from non-target nodes to target outcome nodes

Generated files include:

- `graph_summary.json`
- `node_features.csv`
- `shortest_paths.csv`
- `nearest_targets.csv` — per source: nearest target and best path
- `target_coverage.csv` — per target: how many sources reach it, min/mean/max distance
- `model_metrics.json` — primary-split metrics plus an `iteration_summary` block
- `model_feature_importance.csv` — mean importance across iterations, with `importance_std`
- `model_iteration_metrics.csv` — one row of metrics per evaluation iteration
- `model_permutation_metrics.csv` — one row per null-model permutation (with `--permutation-test`)
- `run_summary.json`
- `plots/*.png` — see Visualization below

## Iterative Evaluation

On small networks a single train/test split is a noisy estimate: the same model
can score 0.35 or 0.55 accuracy depending on which nodes land in the test set.
By default the toolkit re-evaluates the model on 10 different splits
(`--n-iterations 10`) with hyperparameters tuned once on the primary split, and
reports the spread:

```json
"iteration_summary": {
  "accuracy": {"mean": 0.44, "std": 0.06, "min": 0.35, "max": 0.55}
}
```

If the mean is near chance, the graph features carry no signal for the outcome —
which is exactly what the bundled random synthetic data shows. Use
`--n-iterations 1` to reproduce the old single-split behavior, or raise it for
tighter estimates.

## Permutation Null Model

"Near chance" should be measured, not eyeballed. `--permutation-test N` shuffles
the outcome labels N times and re-evaluates with the same tuned configuration
and split scheme, producing an empirical null distribution and a one-sided
p-value per metric:

```bash
python epinet_toolkit.py --permutation-test 100 --no-run-paths
```

```json
"permutation_test": {
  "n_permutations": 100,
  "metrics": {
    "f1_weighted": {"observed_mean": 0.53, "null_mean": 0.50, "null_std": 0.13, "p_value": 0.44}
  }
}
```

A p-value like 0.44 means shuffled labels score as well as the real ones almost
half the time — the features carry no detectable signal. On the bundled random
synthetic data this is the correct conclusion; on real data, demand a small
p-value before trusting any importance ranking.

## Community-Aware Splitting

Random train/test splits assume independent samples, but connected nodes are
not independent: a node's graph features encode information about neighbors
that may sit in the test set. `--split-strategy community` detects communities
(greedy modularity) and keeps each one entirely in train or test:

```bash
python epinet_toolkit.py --split-strategy community --n-iterations 10
```

Scores are typically lower and more variable than with random splits — that is
the honest estimate of how the model generalizes to an unseen region of the
network. Stratification is disabled in this mode (group splits and class
stratification are incompatible), and if the graph collapses into a single
community the run falls back to random splits and records a `split_note` in
the metrics.

## Visualization

Every run writes figures to `<output-dir>/plots/` (disable with `--no-make-plots`):

- `network_overview.png` — spring layout colored by outcome, target nodes
  outlined in red, nearest source→target paths overlaid
- `degree_distribution.png`
- `feature_importance.png` — error bars show cross-iteration variability
- `metric_stability.png` — box plot of metrics across evaluation iterations
- `confusion_matrix.png` — held-out test set of the primary split
- `permutation_null.png` — null distribution vs observed F1 (with `--permutation-test`)

## Shortest-Path Examples

Use outcome-positive nodes as targets:

```bash
python epinet_toolkit.py --outcome-column Outcome --target-outcome 1
```

Use explicit target nodes:

```bash
python epinet_toolkit.py --target-nodes Node_1,Node_5 --no-run-model
```

Limit the sources:

```bash
python epinet_toolkit.py --source-nodes Node_0,Node_9 --target-nodes Node_42 --no-run-model
```

Treat edges as directed:

```bash
python epinet_toolkit.py --directed --target-nodes Node_42 --no-run-model
```

Use an edge weight column as path distance:

```bash
python epinet_toolkit.py --weight-column Weight --path-mode distance --target-nodes Node_42 --no-run-model
```

Be careful: many datasets store edge weight as relationship strength, not distance.
If a larger weight means a stronger or more frequent connection, it should not be used
directly as a shortest-path distance without transformation.

If an edge column is a normalized 0..1 strength, you can ask for the strongest route:

```bash
python epinet_toolkit.py --weight-column Weight --path-mode strength --target-nodes Node_42 --no-run-model
```

## CiteMatch Evidence Graph Example

The `examples/` directory includes a small CiteMatch-style evidence graph:

- `examples/citematch_nodes.csv`
- `examples/citematch_edges.csv`
- `examples/citematch_usecase.md`

Run nearest contrast-evidence paths for three claims:

```bash
python epinet_toolkit.py \
  --nodes examples/citematch_nodes.csv \
  --edges examples/citematch_edges.csv \
  --outcome-column Outcome \
  --target-outcome contrast_evidence \
  --source-nodes claim_osimertinib_dfs,claim_osimertinib_os,claim_chemo_required \
  --no-run-model \
  --output-dir examples/citematch_outputs/contrast_paths
```

This is the safer non-epidemiology use case: the toolkit maps evidence structure
around claims and papers. It does not infer whether a claim is true.

For CiteMatch, avoid calling this a fastest path unless an edge column truly encodes
time or delay. The useful question is usually the best evidence route: nearest by
hops, lowest evidence distance, or strongest relationship path.

## Feature-Space Clustering

Shortest paths measure *topological* distance (hops/weights along edges).
Clustering measures *feature-space* distance instead: each node becomes a
standardized vector of graph features plus numeric attributes, k-means finds
centroids, and each node gets a distance to every outcome-class centroid — a
transparent nearest-centroid (Rocchio) view.

```bash
python epinet_toolkit.py --run-clusters --distance-metric mahalanobis --n-clusters 0
```

- `--n-clusters 0` uses the number of outcome classes when labels exist,
  otherwise selects k by silhouette score.
- `--distance-metric mahalanobis` accounts for correlated/scaled features (the
  graph centralities are highly correlated); `euclidean` is the isotropic default.

Outputs: `node_clusters.csv` (cluster id, distance to own centroid, distance to
each class centroid, nearest-centroid prediction), `cluster_centroids.csv`,
`cluster_summary.json` (silhouette, inertia, cluster×outcome composition,
nearest-centroid in-sample accuracy), and `plots/feature_clusters.png` (a PCA
projection colored by cluster). The nodes whose nearest class centroid disagrees
with their actual label are the feature-space outliers worth inspecting.
`--cluster-labeled-only` skips feature-less scaffold nodes (e.g. patient hubs).

## Pulmonary Nodule Cohort Example

A second real-domain example brings the feature-space clustering to lung-nodule
risk phenotyping, reproducing the published Brock/PanCan, Mayo/Swensen, and
volume-doubling-time models (NTOG lung-risk tools) to generate a synthetic
cohort:

- `examples/build_nodule_cohort.py` — generator (synthetic patients/nodules)
- `examples/nodule_{nodes,edges}.csv`, `examples/nodule_risk_scores.csv`
- `examples/nodule_cohort_usecase.md` — walkthrough and interpretation

Patients are scaffold hubs; nodules are labeled by risk tier and linked to their
patient and siblings, so a community split holds whole patients out. Predicting
risk tier from raw morphology survives that patient-aware split (F1 0.82,
p ≈ 0.005), and the centroid distances flag the boundary nodules whose phenotype
disagrees with their Brock threshold — the second opinion the static calculators
cannot give. The coefficient port is validated against the source formula and
the published odds ratios by `examples/validate_nodule_models.py`.

### Real LIDC-IDRI cohort

`examples/build_lidc_cohort.py` runs the same pipeline on real LIDC-IDRI
radiologist annotations (via `pip install pylidc`, no DICOMs needed): 875 scans,
2651 nodules labeled by median-reader malignancy tier. It is deliberately biased
data (subjective labels, a dominant "indeterminate" hedge tier, 29% of nodules
with ≥2-point inter-reader disagreement). Morphology predicts the tier under a
scan-aware split (F1 0.70, p ≈ 0.01); the model's errors funnel entirely through
the indeterminate middle (it never confuses benign with suspicious), and reader
disagreement turns out largely orthogonal to feature-space ambiguity. See
`examples/lidc_cohort_usecase.md`.

`examples/divergence_topography.py` goes further: it treats the up-to-four
radiologist readers as two independent labelings (split-half) and asks whether
their *disagreement* is structured in feature space. It is — but only shallowly
(accuracy 0.587 vs null 0.527, p ≈ 0.015, barely over the 0.577 base rate):
42% of nodules are internally contested, and that contest is mostly idiosyncratic
to the reader, not the nodule. A pathology drop-in (`--pathology`) runs the same
divergence analysis against a lower-variance reference when the data is supplied.
See `examples/divergence_topography_usecase.md`.

`examples/pathology_validation.py` runs the real version against the TCIA
LIDC-IDRI tissue diagnoses. The headline: on 80 histopathology-confirmed
patients, **93% of radiologist-"indeterminate" cases were malignant** — the
hedge tier hides cancer, and acting only on "suspicious" misses 40% of cancers.
The pathology reference is itself selection-biased (7 benigns; tissue is taken
when cancer is suspected), so specificity is unmeasurable from it — every
reference is a centroid with its own selection topography. See
`examples/pathology_validation_usecase.md`.

## Nordic Lung Cancer Quality-Indicator Example

A larger, real-domain example models lung cancer pathway quality indicators
across the five Nordic countries as a measurement-capability network — country
registries and data-source infrastructure (unlabeled scaffold) plus 17 quality
indicators labeled by feasibility tier:

- `examples/nordic_lung_cancer_qi_nodes.csv` / `..._edges.csv` (generated by
  `examples/build_nordic_lung_cancer_qi.py`)
- `examples/nordic_lung_cancer_qi_usecase.md` — full walkthrough and interpretation

It exercises every lens at once: graph features and centrality, a semi-supervised
outcome model (only the indicators are labeled), community-aware evaluation with a
permutation null, and strength-weighted shortest paths read as **harmonization
routes**. The headline finding is methodological: the outcome model looks
significant under random splits (p ≈ 0.02) but is indistinguishable from chance
under community-aware splits (p ≈ 0.31) — a textbook illustration of why network
dependence inflates naive cross-validation.

## Data Model

Nodes are entities: people, places, organizations, studies, grants, hospitals,
events, risks, exposures, pathway steps, or any other objects.

Edges are relationships or flows between nodes: contact, referral, collaboration,
co-authorship, transition, shared exposure, communication, dependency, or movement.

Default node columns:

- `ID`: unique node identifier
- `Outcome`: optional target label for modeling/path targeting

Default edge columns:

- `SourceID`
- `TargetID`
- optional `Weight`

See `Data-format.md` for details.

## Methodological Boundaries

The model is intentionally simple. It does not infer causality, outbreak dynamics,
clinical risk, or intervention effects. Network features can be useful descriptors,
but they can also encode sampling bias, measurement bias, and structural confounding.

Use the outputs as exploratory evidence, not as decisions.

Before using this for health, education, welfare, employment, or public-sector
decisions, add:

- domain-specific data validation
- directed/temporal assumptions
- uncertainty and sensitivity checks
- external validation
- privacy and governance review
- human review of any operational recommendations
